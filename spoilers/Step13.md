We are presented with an image of the Declaration of Independence from the movie National Treasure. The code here is an Ottendorf Cipher. In the movie it decodes to the page - line - letter of a specific text.

Here we are given a Year - Page - Line - Word - Letter, and to decode, we use the DEFCON programs of years past. 

20-15-40-3-7 = DEFCON 20, Page 15, Line 40, Word 3, and Letter 7 = "e"

After decoding all the letters, you get 

"emailthedecodedbottomboardtoyouhadtheanswerthewholetime@mkfactorcom"

Or, "email the decoded bottom board to 'youhadtheanswerthewholetime@mkfactor.com' "

Another vigenere encrypted message can be found inside the badge when taken apart:

This message also uses the same `DEFCON` key as the previous vigenere cipher and decodes to:

```
we are the signal
```
