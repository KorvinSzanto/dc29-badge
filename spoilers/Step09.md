The page title is "Reminiscing" and displays the following encrypted message:

```
Zlnns jh'zj uvnuii vvr vmlpoy ivto anqc xrcgv,
xmgfr'v ssg hudx xvoagw fdcih xmg frvx.
Nv'g n vmrrzr spfes jlxmqig wlj uzbww,

```

Viewing the HTML source, we see a comment as well:

```
<!-- ivtrarer -->
```

This comment is a ROT13 encoded message that decodes to:

```
vigenere
```

Which indicates the encoded message is using a vigenere cipher.

Brute force decoding yields the key: `DEFCON`

..and the following decoded message:

```
While we've shared the signal from many spots,
there's one that stands above the rest.
It's a simple place without the slots,
some people still think it's the best.
```

This hint refers to the first hotel DEF CON was held at: `AlexisPark`
